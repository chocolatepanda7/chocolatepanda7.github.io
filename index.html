  <p>Curious George is a cartoon for little kids but if people that are now older they can also watch it to remember their childhood.</p>

  <p> Curious George is really funny, I used to watch it when I was younger and I really loved it. And I think it helped me understand babies because how he doesn't talk and makes noises, babies do that and I understand them
